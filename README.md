*Tutor - Part time*

• Re-engineered lesson content to be more effective in a virtual environment, for Mathematics, Computer Science, Saxophone Performance, and Music Theory; a solution to not having in person lessons, and making content more absorbable

## Project Experience

### **Custom Lexical Analyzer** --- Program | Compilers 

Feb. 2021 – Mar. 2021 

Software Development Team work


• Constructed a 5 component Finite State Machine in order to handle the various states of the lexer
• Reinforced several compiler concepts such as Tokens & Lexemes, Buffering, Finite-State Automata, and Regular Expressions.


### **Multi-Threading Application** | Operating Systems Concepts 

Feb. 2021 – Mar. 2021 

Software Development Team work


• Conducted evaluation analysis on 4 of the most common process & disk scheduling algorithms; First Come-First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF, non-preemptive), Round Robin (RR, quantum = 5 milliseconds), and Priority (with 3 priority levels)
• Related the threading, process synchronization, and deadlock concepts covered in class to a real-world problem.
• Discovered the challenges of debugging race conditions and deadlocks, and learned how to prevent them


### **Triangle Area** --- Program | x86 Assembly Programming 

Oct. 2020 – Nov. 2020 

Individual Software Development


• Implemented the feature which accepts input three quadword float numbers representing the sides of a triangle. After confirming that the inputs are in fact valid floats then compute the area of the triangle using Heron’s formula.
• Equipped the program with error handling, and is avoids crashing when a user inputs a length value outside acceptable parameters


### **Sorting Race** --- Web Application | Algorithm Engineering 

Sep. 2019 – Oct. 2019 

Software Development Team work


• Revamped the traditional Sorting Algorithm Race into a program that launches in web browser of choice
• Illustrated the various algorithm steps and the generational (i.e. one row per pass) progress of several different sorting algorithms, side by
side in their own columns; Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Pore's Gold Sort, Quick Sort
• Coded all of the visuals, logic, and algorithm implementations in P5 Javascript, HTML, and CSS
• Documented several sections of concept integration, development process, setup & installation, external requirements, features, and contents


### **Grocery Database** --- Program | Data Structures 

Jan. 2020 – May 2020 

Individual Software Development


• Implemented 10 data structures including the Array, Vector, SL List, DL List, Stack, Queue, Map, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree Unordered Container (Heap), using STL and non-STL design
• Performed 2 comparison analysis tests between the containers, highlighting their respective Big-O Complexity on various container operations and search algorithms


### **Pi Kappa Alpha Event Planning Committee** | Fullerton, CA 

Aug. 2018 – Dec. 2018 

Special Interest Group Leader
